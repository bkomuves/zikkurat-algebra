Pure Haskell implementation of finite fields
--------------------------------------------

This is a somewhat inefficient, but standalone, pure Haskell implementation of 
finite fields (and some more) used in zero-knowledge proofs. 

It can be used when an optimized implementation is not available, or would
be a too complicated dependency (for example, during generating the code for 
that optimized implementation).
